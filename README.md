# agencyCreativeStaticWebsite
This is a static website I created using SASS and HTML for a Creative Agency brand. 

I used the VS Code IDE to create this site and used Live SASS and live server for viewing the website as I coded.

I learned how to create a mobile first design and developed the site as a mobile first site by the way I implemented my media queries.

I also created my first from scratch HTML form and used form spree for email sending so that you don't have to create a backend on this site. 

This site is to mainly showcase my knowledge and skills in HTML and SASS/CSS.
